# Python-Practise 

# This repository includes python files, where I was practising and revising my python concepts. I found some of the common questions on different online platforms and used them to practice. I have also added a pdf of all the questions I have practiced in case someone wishes to revise the concepts and wants to take a sneak-peak, instead of spending hours finding the questions.
